/**
 * Declares an exclusive, server-named queue and binds it to an existing
 * exchange.  This is probably the easiest way to start prototyping with an
 * {@link com.rapportive.storm.spout.AMQPSpout}: if your app already publishes
 * to an exchange, you can just point this at the exchange and start consuming
 * messages.
 *
 * <p>However <strong>N.B.</strong> this queue setup <em>is not reliable</em>,
 * in that if the spout task crashes or restarts, messages published while the
 * spout is down will be lost (because the spout creates the queue when it
 * starts up, and the server deletes the queue when the spout closes).</p>
 *
 * <p>It also cannot scale out to multiple parallel spout tasks.  The semantics
 * of an exclusive queue mean that each spout task would get its own queue
 * bound to the exchange.  That means each task would receive a copy of every
 * message, so messages would get processed multiple times.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you need guaranteed processing or a horizontally scalable spout,
 * consider {@link SharedQueueWithBinding}.</p>
